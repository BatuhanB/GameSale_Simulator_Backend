# GameSale_Simulator_Backend
## This is a basic project for OOP basics.
## Requirements
1. Simulate an environment where players can register to the system, update their information, and delete their registrations. We want to verify the accuracy of customer information using e-government systems. (In e-government systems, verification is done with TcNo, Name, Surname, Year of Birth. You just need to simulate the service that will do this.)

2. Simulate the sales environment where the game can be sold. (The sales made should be associated with the player. I mean the player in the method as a parameter.)

3. Simulate the possibilities of entering a new campaign into the system, deleting and updating the campaign.

4. Simulate campaign integration in sales.
